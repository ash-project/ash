# Changelog

<!-- changelog -->

## [v3.4.49](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.48...v3.4.49) (2024-12-22)




### Bug Fixes:

* [`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`] ensure that old config applies all aggregate policies

If you've upgraded to the following configuration this does not affect you:

```elixir
config :ash, :policies, no_filter_static_forbidden_reads?: false
```

You should upgrade regardless, and adopt that new configuration.

## [v3.4.48](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.47...v3.4.48) (2024-12-20)

### Bug Fixes:

- [calculations] properly update sort calculation expressions

- [`Ash.Type.Module`] handle nil values in `Ash.Type.Module`

- [`Ash.Resource`] ensure that `select_by_default?` is honored on loads

- [`Ash.Type.Union`] Verify union types constraint on init

### Improvements:

- [Igniter] handle igniter not being compiled, and make it optional

- [`Ash.Generator`] add `Ash.Generator.next_in_sequence/3`

- [pagination] add `show_keysets_for_all_actions?` configuration

  Set `config :ash, show_keysets_for_all_actions?, false` for significant performance
  improvements when reading resources that support keyset pagination. This causes
  keysets to only be shown for actions that are actively being paginated with
  keyset pagination.

- [`Ash.Filter`] Handle Ash.Query.filter for array values (#1452)

- [`Ash.Type.Time`] cast embedded time properly (#1451)

- [create actions] require private/non-accepted attributes _after_ before action hooks instead of _before_

- [built in after_action change] we cannot assume that `after_action/1` can be done atomically

  Previously, when you did `change after_action/3` in a resource, we would assume it was safe to be done atomically.
  But because we cannot guarantee that your hook does not access `changeset.data`, it is not safe to make that assumption.

  Instead, you must define a module change, and explicitly define `atomic/3`.

### Improvements:

- [`Ash.Error.Forbidden.Policy`] small improvements for policy breakdown formatting

- [`Ash.Type.Union`] honor a `_union_type` type param when casting unions

- [create/update/destroy actions] add system for `action_select`, which can limit selects from mutations

  Callers can `select` when calling create/update/destroy actions, but those selects were not previously honored
  by data layers. The reason for this is that often actions will require more fields than the fields that the caller
  requests. Now, you can specify `action_select` in the action, and the data layer will honor that.

  Additionally, the new `select_by_default?` flag on attributes causes the attribute to automatically not be selected
  for update actions.

- [attributes] support `select_by_default?` flag on attributes. This defaults to `true`.

## [v3.4.8](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.7...v3.4.8) (2024-09-09)

- [`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`] don't report the action as the actor for policy breakdowns

- [`Ash.Changeset`] check `changeset.action` before raising a required primary action error

- [bulk actions] ensure proper return types for `:stream` strategy bulk update/destroys

## [v3.4.7](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.6...v3.4.7) (2024-09-06)

### Improvements:

- [`Ash.Resource.Igniter`] add `add_bypass` and `add_policy` igniter utilities

## [v3.4.6](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.5...v3.4.6) (2024-09-06)

### Bug Fixes:

- [loading relationships] don't select destination attributes that don't exist

- [`Ash.Filter.Runtime`] properly pass actor when running filters at runtime

- [`Ash.Type.Struct`] misplaced curly bracket when handling struct type casting

- [bulk/atomic updates] properly leverage atomic upgrade read action for an update action

### Improvements:

- [`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`] show the actor's primary key in policy breakdowns

- [`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`] add an expanded description option to checks

- [`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`] use expanded description to display filled in filter templates in policy breakdowns

## [v3.4.4](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.3...v3.4.4) (2024-09-05)

## [v3.4.3](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.2...v3.4.3) (2024-09-04)

### Bug Fixes:

- [loading relationships] properly await tasks from lazy loading multiple relationships

## [v3.4.2](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/compare/v3.4.1...v3.4.2) (2024-09-04)

### Bug Fixes:

- [`Ash.DataLayer.Ets`] properly apply distinct in ets

### Improvements with backwards compatibility configurations

These configurations default to the current behavior, but in 4.0 (someday) will
be removed, and the new option will be the only option.

- [pagination] make default page type configurable, defaulting to `:offset`.

```elixir
# set this configuration to adopt the new preferred behavior
config :ash,
  default_page_type: :keyset
```

- [`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`] make read policies more consistent, always preferring to filter over raise

Currently, some read actions can still return a `Forbidden` error, even
though policies are meant to filter out records by default. Now, it will always
filter, unless you set `access_type :strict` in the policy.

```elixir
# set this configuration to adopt the new preferred behavior
config :ash, :policies,
  no_filter_static_forbidden_reads?: false
```

### Improvements:

- [`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`] show an explanation when a forbidden is because no policies applied

### Breaking Changes:

For a guide on adjusting to these breaking changes, see the [upgrade guide](/documentation/topics/development/upgrading-to-3.0.md)

- [Ash.Api] has been renamed to `Ash.Domain`, and references to the concept have been renamed as well, i.e in options and in the DSL
- [Ash] we now call functions on this, isntead of the domain. i.e `Ash.create` and `Ash.read`. The generated functions are now marked as deprecated
- [Ash] remove process context functionality. You can no longer store the actor/tenant in the context with `Ash.set_actor` and so on
- [private?] deprecate `private?: false` in favor of the more explicit `public?: true`
- [default_accept] default `default_accept` is now `[]`
- [action lifecycle] after transaction hooks cannot be added from inside of other lifecycle hooks
- [Ash.NotLoaded] use `%Ash.NotLoaded{}` for unselected values, instead of `nil`
- [require_atomic?] now defaults to `true`, requiring opt-out of atomic behavior
- [authorization] default `api.authorization.authorize` to `:by_default`
- [Ash.Registry] has been removed
- [actions] `domain` must always be known when constructing changesets
- [Ash.Notifier] `requires_original_data?/2` callback defaults to `false`
- [Ash.Notifier.PubSub] default to `previous_values?: false`, allowing notifications to be sent for atomic updates
- [unknown inputs] all action invocations now use `UnknownInput` errors when given an input they don't accept
- [policies] `requires_original_data?/2` callback on checks defaults to `false`
- [Ash.Calculation] has been renamed to `Ash.Resource.Calculation`
- [Ash.Resource.Calculation] "strict mode" has been added and defaults to `true`. This causes only explicitly requested fields from relationships to be loaded
- [Ash.Query.Calculation] positional arguments are now an options list
- [calculations] anonymous function calculations in a resource now take lists and return lists, instead of a single record (like standard calculations do)
- [context] The context argument passed to many different callbacks is now a struct, tailored to that specific context. For example, in a calculation you will receive an `Ash.Resource.Calculation.Context`
- [after_action/before_action] These builtin changes now accept a 3rd context argument
- [picosat_elixir] is now optional (`simple_sat` is now an alternative)
- [Ash.Changeset] `Ash.Changeset.new!` has been removed
- [Ash.Changeset] `Ash.Changeset.new/2` has been removed (`Ash.Changeset.new/1` is still available)
- [Ash.Changeset] `changeset.filters` is now `changeset.filter`
- [Ash.Changeset] reverse order of before action & before transaction hooks. They now run in the action they are added. They used to run in reverse order.
- [Ash.CiString] `Ash.CiString.new/1` returns `nil` on `nil` input
- [belongs_to.attribute_writable?] add `attribute_public?` for controlling publicity, and default `attribute_writable?` to `true`.
- [Ash.Filter.TemplateHelpers] removed, all functions needed for expressions are now defined in `Ash.Expr`
- [Ash.Expr] keyword lists are no longer special cased in ash expressions, and requiring pinning like any other value.
- [Ash.Resource] default read actions are now paginatable with keyset and offset pagination (but pagination is not required)
- [Ash.Resource] default actions require explicit accept lists (or will use `default_accept`). i.e `defaults [:read, create: [:first_name, :last_name]]`
- [Ash.Resource] `simple_notifiers` is now an option to `use Ash.Resource`, instead of being in the DSL at `resource.simple_notifiers`
- [Ash.Flow] has been removed and put in its own package `ash_flow`. It is being deprecated in favor of `Reactor`
- [Ash.Error] the implementation has been extracted out to `Splode`. Defining new `Ash.Error`s is now done by defining a new `Splode.Error`
- [Ash.Query] swap position of sort order and arguments in calculation sorting, i.e instead of `calculation: {:asc, %{...args}}` it is now `calculation: {%{...args}, :asc}`
- [Ash.Resource.Aggregate] add `include_nil?` aggregate option, and default it to `false` (so `list` and `first` aggregates do not consider `nil` values by default)
- [Ash.Policy.FilterCheck] now accepts `context` arguments, like `Ash.Policy.FilterCheckWithContext`
- [Ash.Policy.FilterCheckWithContext] has been removed, use `Ash.Policy.FilterCheck`

### Features:

- [Ash.Type] add new remove_nil_items? array type constraint (#1116)
- [Ash.Query] Paginatable relationships (#1050)
- [Ash.DataLayer] new `calculate/3` callback that allows for data layers to compute the result of expressions outside the context of a query. Used to power `Ash.calculate/3`.
- [validations] new builtin validations, `attributes_present/2` and `attributes_absent/2`
- [multitenancy] configurable multitenancy behaviour on read actions (#1030)
- [Ash.Reactor] Add new `change` step type which can be used to modify changesets.
- [Ash.Changeset] add `Ash.Changeset.update_change/2` function and builtin change (#976)
- [Ash.Domain] code interfaces can now be defined on the domain
- [Ash.Domain] policies can now be defined on the domain, and will run before resource policies
- [Ash.ToTenant] add `Ash.ToTenant`, allowing for passing arbitrary values as tenants
- [Ash] add `Ash.read_first` (like `Ash.read_one`, but applies a limit automatically)
- [Ash] support a second optional `input` option for `create`, `update` and `destroy`, allowing for things like `Ash.create!(Post, %{text: "text"}, opts)`
- [sensitive?] support `sensitive?` option in query aggregate/calculation (#963)
- [Ash.Resource] support `require_reference?: false` on code interfaces, for when an update or destroy action uniquely identifies a record (or for bulk update/destroy)
- [Ash.Resource] notifiers can now be specified for specific actions, using the `notifiers` option
- [mix ash.rollback] delegates to extensions to trigger their rollback tasks
- [Ash.Query] add `Ash.Query.apply_to/3`, to "apply" the query to a set of records (i.e filter, sort, distinct, etc.)
- [Ash.CustomExpression] Use `Ash.CustomExpression` to extend Ash's expression syntax in a data-layer agnostic way
- [code interface] Code interface functions now support bulk actions, in a "do what I mean" way. For example: `Domain.deactive(post)` can also be `Post |> Ash.Query.filter(active == true) |> Domain.deactive()`

### Improvements:

- [Ash.Actions.Sort] allow providing a stream of records to sort, and performance improvements
- [bulk actions] add `read_action` option to bulk actions (#1088)
- [Ash.stream] support streaming with offset, or even _no_ pagination
- [Ash.DataLayer.Ets] add debug logging, similar to ecto query debug logging
- [Ash.DataLayer.Ets] support update_query, destroy_query and `Ash.Changeset.filter/2`
- [Embedded resources] don't add `autogenerated_id` to embeds if they don't have a primary key
- [Ash.Resource] you can now omit the return type of generic actions, indicating it either succeeds or fails, returning `:ok` or `{:error, error}`
- [Ash.Resource] Generic actions can now accept a Reactor module, running it directly. (#993)
- [Ash.Resource] support `allow_nil_input` dsl option in update/destroy actions (#964)
- [Ash.Resource] The `filter` option can now be supplied multiple times in read actions and in relationships. They will be combined with `and`
- [Ash.Resource] private attributes can now be accepted as action inputs
- [Ash.Expr] is now imported automatically into places you will likely use it, like changes, validations, checks and calculations.
- [Ash.Query] is now required automatically in places you will likely use it, as above
- [sortable?] fields may mark themselves as unusable in sorts by using `sortable? false`
- [sensitive?] calculations and aggregates may now also be marked as `sensitive?`

### Bug Fixes:

- [Ash.Type] apply array type `nil_items?` constraint after item constraints are applied (#1115)
- [Ash.DataLayer.Ets] fix ETS data layer's support for lateral joining
- [bulk actions] ensure transaction is rolled back on data layer errors during streaming
- [bulk actions] set `notify?: true` when `return_notifications?: true` is set
- [Ash.Changeset] `attributes_present?/2` -> `attribute_present?/2`
- [Ash.Filter] don't eager evaluate `type/3` because data layers require type information
- [Ash.Changeset] when comparing identities for `manage_relationship`, we now properly cast the values. Before, `"1"` and `1` were not considered equal for integer primary keys/identity fields
- Many more bug fixes were added, but few are relevant enough to list here
