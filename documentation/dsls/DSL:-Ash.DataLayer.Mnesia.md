# DSL: Ash.DataLayer.Mnesia

An Mnesia backed Ash Datalayer.

In your application initialization, you will need to call `Mnesia.create_schema([node()])`.

Additionally, you will want to create your mnesia tables there.

This data layer is *unoptimized*, fetching all records from a table and filtering them
in memory. For that reason, it is not recommended to use it with large amounts of data. It can be
great for prototyping or light usage, though.


## mnesia
