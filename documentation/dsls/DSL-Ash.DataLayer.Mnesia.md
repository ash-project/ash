# Ash.DataLayer.Mnesia

An Mnesia backed Ash Datalayer.

In your application initialization, you will need to call `Mnesia.create_schema([node()])`.

Additionally, you will want to create your mnesia tables there.

## Performance

This data layer uses Mnesia matchspecs to push filter operations down to the database
level when possible. Supported filters (equality, comparison, boolean logic, etc.) are
converted to matchspecs for efficient querying. Unsupported filters fall back to
runtime filtering in memory. Due to this limitation, unsupported filtering may
have an effect on performance as filtering occurs in memory. For more on the
supported options see `Ash.DataLayer.Mnesia.MatchSpec`.
