# DSL: Ash.Flow.Dsl

The built in flow DSL.

## Halting

Steps can be halted, which will stop the flow from continuing and return a halted flow. To attach a specific reason, use a `halt_reason`.
If you need more complex halting logic, then you'd want to use a custom step, and return `{:error, Ash.Error.Flow.Halted.exception(...)}`


## flow
Details about the flow itself, like description and the successful return type.
