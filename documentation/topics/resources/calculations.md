# Calculations

Calculations in Ash allow for displaying complex values as a top level value of a resource.

## Primer

## Declaring calculations on a resource

### Expression Calculations

The simplest kind of calculation refers to an Ash expression. For example:

```elixir
calculations do
  calculate :full_name, :string, expr(first_name <> " " <> last_name)
end
```

See the [Expressions guide](/documentation/topics/reference/expressions.md) for more.

### Module Calculations

When calculations require more complex code or can't be pushed down into the data layer, a module that uses `Ash.Resource.Calculation` can be used.

```elixir
defmodule Concat do
  # An example concatenation calculation, that accepts the delimiter as an argument,
  #and the fields to concatenate as options
  use Ash.Resource.Calculation

  # Optional callback that verifies the passed in options (and optionally transforms them)
  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    if opts[:keys] && is_list(opts[:keys]) && Enum.all?(opts[:keys], &is_atom/1) do
      {:ok, opts}
    else
      {:error, "Expected a `keys` option for which keys to concat"}
    end
  end

  @impl true
  # A callback to tell Ash what keys must be loaded/selected when running this calculation
  # you can include related data here, but be sure to include the attributes you need from said related data
  # i.e `posts: [:title, :body]`.
  def load(_query, opts, _context) do
    opts[:keys]
  end

  @impl true
  def calculate(records, opts, %{arguments: %{separator: separator}}) do
    Enum.map(records, fn record ->
      Enum.map_join(opts[:keys], separator, fn key ->
        to_string(Map.get(record, key))
      end)
    end)
  end

  # You can implement this callback to make this calculation possible in the data layer
  # *and* in elixir. Ash expressions are already executable in Elixir or in the data layer, but this gives you fine grain control over how it is done
  # See the expressions guide for more.
  # @impl true
  # def expression(opts, context) do
  #   expr(your_expression_here)
  # end
end

# Usage in a resource
calculations do
  calculate :full_name, :string, {Concat, keys: [:first_name, :last_name]} do
    # You need to use the [allow_empty?: true, trim?: false] constraints here.
    # The separator could be an empty string or require a leading or trailing space,
    # but would be trimmed or even set to `nil` without the constraints shown below.
    argument :separator, :string do
      allow_nil? false
      constraints [allow_empty?: true, trim?: false]
      default ""
    end
  end
end
```

See the documentation for the calculations section in [Resource DSL docs](dsl-ash-resource.html#calculations) and the `Ash.Resource.Calculation` docs for more information.

The calculations declared on a resource allow for declaring a set of named calculations that can be used by extensions.
They can also be loaded in the query using `Ash.Query.load/2`, or after the fact using `Ash.load/3`. Calculations declared on the resource will be keys in the resource's struct.

## Custom calculations in the query

Example:

```elixir
User
|> Ash.Query.calculate(:full_name, {Concat, keys: [:first_name, :last_name]}, :string, %{separator: ","})
```

See the documentation for `Ash.Query.calculate/4` for more information.

## Arguments in calculations

Using the above example with arguments, you can load a calculation with arguments like so:

```elixir
load(full_name: [separator: ","])
```

If the calculation uses an expression, you can also filter and sort on it like so:

```elixir
query
|> Ash.Query.filter(full_name(separator: " ") == "Zach Daniel")
|> Ash.Query.sort(full_name: {%{separator: " "}, :asc})
```

## Loading Calculations

When loading calculations, you specify them in the load statement just like relationships and aggregates.

```elixir
# load
Ash.load!(user, [full_name: %{separator: ","}])
# => %User{full_name: "Zach,Daniel"}
```

### Loading with a custom name

Every record in Ash also has a `calculations` field, where arbitrarily named calculations can live.
See `Ash.Query.calculate/4` for more. To do this with `load` statements, you use the reserved
`as` key in the calculation arguments.

```elixir
# load
Ash.load!(user, [
  full_name: %{separator: " ", as: :full_name_with_spaces},
  full_name: %{separator: ",", as: :full_name_with_commas}
])
# => %User{calculations: %{full_name_with_spaces: "Zach Daniel", full_name_with_commas: "Zach,Daniel"}}
```

### Loading "through" calculations

If you have calculations that produce records, or loadable types like `Ash.Type.Map` and `Ash.Type.Struct`
you can load further things on those records by providing a tuple of calculation input and further load statements.


```elixir
# here is a map type that contains a user and a status
defmodule MyApp.Types.UserAndStatus do
  use Ash.Type.NewType, subtype_of: :map, constraints: [
    fields: [
      user: [
        type: :struct,
        instance_of: MyApp.User
      ],
      status: [
        type: :atom,
        constraints: [one_of: [:active, :inactive]]
      ]
    ]
  ]
end

# on our organization resource, we might have a calculation that returns a user and their status
calculate :user_statuses, {:array, MyApp.Types.UserAndStatus}, GetUsersAndTheirStatuses
```

You could then load this calculation like so:

```elixir
Ash.load!(organization, :user_statuses)
# => [%{user: %User{}, status: :active}, %{user: %User{}, status: :inactive}]
```

But what if you wanted additional fields from the calculated user? To do this, we provide
a tuple of additional loads alongside their arguments. Maps support loading "through"
fields by using the configured fields in the map and providing further loads.

```elixir
# {arguments, additional_load_statement}
Ash.load!(organization, user_statuses: {%{}, [user: [full_name: %{separator: " "}]]}),
# => [%{user: %User{full_name: "Zach Daniel"}, status: :active}, %{user: %User{full_name: "Tobey Maguire"}, status: :inactive}]
```
