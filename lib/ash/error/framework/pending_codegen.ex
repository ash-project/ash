    Don't worry! This just means Ash needs to generate some files based on your recent changes.

    Here's what you can do:

    üöÄ Ready to generate the files? Create temporary development files so you can keep working:

           mix ash.codegen --dev

    üîç Want to see what will be generated?

           mix ash.codegen --dry-run

    ‚úÖ Finished with your changes? Create final production-ready files:

           mix ash.codegen <describe_your_changes>

    ‚ÄºÔ∏è Don't forget to run `mix ash.codegen` without the `--dev` flag before you
       wrap up!

       Add the following to your CI pipeline to ensure you've always generated up
       to date files, and that no --dev files are left behind.

           mix ash.codegen --check
