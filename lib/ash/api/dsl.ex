  A small DSL for declaring APIs

  Apis are the entrypoints for working with your resources.

  Apis may optionally include a list of resources, in which case they can be
  used as an `Ash.Registry` in various places. This is for backwards compatibility,
  but if at all possible you should define an `Ash.Registry` if you are using an extension
  that requires a list of resources. For example, most extensions look for two application
  environment variables called `:ash_apis` and `:ash_registries` to find any potential registries
