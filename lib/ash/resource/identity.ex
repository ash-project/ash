defmodule Ash.Resource.Identity do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a unique constraint on a resource

  Data layers should (and all built in ones do), discount `nil` or `null` (in the case of postgres) values
  when determining if a unique constraint matches. This often means that you should
  prefer to use identities with non-nullable columns.

  Eventually, features could be added to support including `nil` or `null` values, but they would
  need to include a corresponding feature for data layers.
