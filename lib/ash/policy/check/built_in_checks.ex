  This check always passes.

  Can be useful for "deny-list" style authorization. For example:

  ```elixir
  policy action_type(:read) do
    forbid_if actor_attribute_equals(:disabled, true)
    forbid_if actor_attribute_equals(:active, false)
    authorize_if always()
  end

  Without that last clause, the policy would never pass.

  This check is true when the action type matches the provided type

  This is useful for writing policies that apply to all actions of a given type.

  For example:

  ```elixir
  policy action_type(:read) do
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)
  end
  ```

  This check is true when the field provided is being referenced anywhere in a filter statement.

  This applies to related filters as well. For example:

  ```elixir

    forbid_if filtering_on(:email)
    # a path can be provided as well
    forbid_if filtering_on([:owner], :email)

  The first will return true in situations like:

  ```elixir
  Ash.Query.filter(User, email == "blah")
  Ash.Query.filter(Tweet, author.email == "blah")

  Ash.Query.filter(Comment, post.owner.email == "blah")

  This check is true when the field is being selected and false when it is not.

  This won't affect filters placed on this resource, so you may also want to either:

  - Mark the given field as `filterable? false`
  - Add another check for `filtering_on(:field)`

  For example:

  ```elixir
  policy action_type(:read) do
    # The actor can read and filter on their own email
    authorize_if expr(id == ^actor(:id))

    # No one else can select or filter on their email
    forbid_if selecting(:email)
    forbid_if filtering_on(:email)

  This check passes if the data relates to the actor via the specified relationship or path of relationships.

  For `update` & `destroy` actions, this check will apply to *the original data* before the changes are applied.

  For `create` actions this check is very unlikely to pass. This is because relationships are modified *after* authorization
  happens, not before.

  For example:

  ```elixir
  policy action_type(:read) do
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via(:owner)

    # Path of relationships:
    authorize_if relates_to_actor_via([:account, :user])
