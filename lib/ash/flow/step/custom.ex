        Whether or not this step can be run outside of the current process. Defaults to true.

        Generally speaking, you should also set the `touches_resources` if you set `async?` to true.
        This ensures that the custom step will be run synchronously if any of those resource's data
        layers is in a corresponding transaction. You don't necessarily need to set *all* of the
        resources that will be touched. For example, all AshPostgres resources that share the same
        repo share the same transaction state.
