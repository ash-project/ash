### Contributor checklist

- [ ] My commit messages follow the [Conventional Commit Message Format](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#format-of-the-commit-message)
      For example: `fix: Multiply by appropriate coefficient`, or
      `feat(Calculator): Correctly preserve history`
      Any explanation or long form information in your commit message should be
      in a separate paragraph, separated by a blank line from the primary message
- [ ] Bug fixes include regression tests
- [ ] Features include unit/acceptance tests
