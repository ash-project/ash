Fix misleading error message for duplicate use Ash.Domain (#1537)

Problem:
When use Ash.Domain was called multiple times in a module, the compile
error pointed to the defmodule line (line 1) and showed a confusing
message ("def can?/3 defines defaults multiple times"), making it hard
to find the actual duplicate invocation.

Solution:
- In lib/ash/domain/domain.ex: detect duplicate use Ash.Domain in
  handle_opts/1 via a module attribute; raise CompileError with
  file/line from __ENV__ so the error points to the second invocation,
  and include a clear message with the line number of the first call.
- In lib/ash/domain/interface.ex: apply the same pattern for
  use Ash.Domain.Interface so duplicate-interface errors are consistent.
- In test/domain/domain_test.exs: update the existing duplicate-use test
  to assert the error line is 3 (second use), and that the description
  contains "use Ash.Domain", "can only be called once", and
  "Remove the duplicate".
