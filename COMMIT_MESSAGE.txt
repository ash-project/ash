Fix misleading error message for duplicate use Ash.Domain (#1537)

- Error now correctly points to the second 'use Ash.Domain' line instead of defmodule
- Error message clearly indicates which line had the first call
- Applied same fix to Ash.Domain.Interface for consistency
- Added test to verify error points to correct line
