# Protocol Creation Best Practices

> **⚠️ This document is still under development.**

This document will provide actionable best practices for creating stable GAB protocols that require fewer modifications and bug fixes. The content is being developed based on real-world protocol creation experiences.

## Coming Soon

This guide will cover best practices for:
- Designing communication and interaction protocols
- Defining protocol specifications and contracts
- Implementing protocol handlers with actors
- Managing protocol state and transitions
- Error handling and protocol violations
- Protocol versioning and compatibility
- And more...

For now, see [Agent Creation Best Practices](agent-creation-best-practices.md) for general GAB development practices that apply to protocols as well.
